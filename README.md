# InsightDataChallenge
This problem solved with R programming
Pure data Structure used (just some simple search to find the department, product, and number of requests)
The output contains 4 columns regarding the request, such as the number of products requested for each department, the number of order that requested for the first time and the ratio of these two columns.
The first column specified the department.
